# Welcome!

This is the code for my personal website hosted at [beni.tech](https://www.beni.tech).

## Contributing

Since this is just my personal website, I most likely won't be looking for any external contributions.

If you find one of the small side-project apps within the repo useful, let me know and I can split it out into a separate repo.
If you do need help running this or writing code for this repo, again just get in touch :)

Apologies if the code style isn't the best and that there are no tests - I promise my actual production code tends to be in a better shape!
